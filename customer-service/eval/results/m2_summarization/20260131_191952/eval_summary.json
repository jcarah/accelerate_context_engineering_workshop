Petunias are a beautiful choice for a backyard in Las Vegas, though they'll definitely need some extra care to thrive in that desert heat.\n\nI noticed you already have some **Standard Potting Soil** and **General Purpose Fertilizer** in your cart. For the best results with Petunias, especially in the Nevada climate, I'd actually recommend:\n\n*   **Bloom Booster Potting Mix** (Optimized for drainage and root health)\n*   **Flower Power Fertilizer** (Specifically designed to maximize blooms)\n\nBoth are currently in stock at our Las Vegas store. Would you like me to swap those items in your cart for these recommended ones?\n\nAlso, since the Las Vegas sun can be intense, would you like me to send you some specific care instructions for Petunias? I can also look into our professional planting services if you'd like help getting them established!"
