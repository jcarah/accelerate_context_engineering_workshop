You are an expert AI evaluation analyst. Your task is to produce a deep technical diagnosis of an AI agent's performance. You MUST base your analysis exclusively on the context provided below.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  **Focus on Diagnosis, Not Recommendations:** Your primary goal is to explain *why* the metrics are what they are. Do not provide a future-looking action plan or make recommendations about business decisions. Stick to a root cause analysis of the current state.
2.  **Synthesize, Don't Summarize:** Do not simply repeat the scores. Your value is in synthesizing insights by connecting the metric scores, the metric definitions, the source code, and the raw explanations.
3.  **Reference Your Sources:** When you make a claim or analyze a metric, you MUST reference the specific source file (e.g., `metric_definitions.json`, `deterministic_metrics.py`, `agent.py`).
4.  **Analyze Calculation Methods:** For each metric you discuss, you MUST explain how its calculation method (deterministic vs. LLM-judged) influences its interpretation.
5.  **CRITICAL: Diagnose the Evaluation Itself:** Your analysis is not limited to the agent's code. You MUST also diagnose potential flaws in the evaluation setup. If a metric score seems incorrect or misleading, investigate the interaction between the question's metadata, the agent's expected behavior, and the metric's calculation logic.

**Technical Performance Diagnosis**

*   **Objective:** Provide a detailed root cause analysis of the agent's performance by linking metric scores to the agent's underlying source code, prompts, and execution logic. This includes identifying when low scores are caused by flaws in the evaluation methodology itself.

*   **Structure:**
    1.  **Overall Performance Summary:** Briefly state the agent's key strengths and weaknesses, supported by 2-3 primary metrics. Highlight any metrics that may be misleading due to evaluation flaws.
    2.  **Deep Dive Diagnosis:** For each major finding, present a detailed hypothesis.
        *   **Finding:** State the observation.
        *   **Supporting Metrics:** List the specific metrics and scores that support this finding.
        *   **Root Cause Hypothesis:** Provide a detailed, evidence-based hypothesis connecting the metric, the source code, and the evaluation data.

**Context for Your Analysis**

You are provided with the following context files to perform your diagnosis. Use them to connect the agent's behavior (the metrics) to its underlying implementation (the code).

**1. Overall Performance Data:**
*   **Evaluation Summary:** High-level average scores for all metrics. Use this to identify the most significant areas of success and failure.

**Sample Explanations:**
- [Score: 1.0] The AI successfully identified 'backyard' and generalized 'Petunias' to 'flowers' within the 'garden_profile'. However, it failed to extract 'Las Vegas' and, critically, completely missed the product name 'Bloom Booster Potting Mix' and its 'Product ID: soil-456', which were central to the user's request for stock check and adding to cart. The session state does not reflect these key entities or the user's current intent, indicating major errors in capturing essential information.
- [Score: 1.0] The AI failed to extract and store critical information from the user's current prompt, specifically the identified plant 'Fern' and the explicit request to send 'care instructions' for it. The provided state only contains a static customer profile, which is likely pre-loaded and does not reflect any new information parsed from this specific interaction.
- [Score: 1.0] The session state contains a detailed 'customer_profile' which might be relevant for the first user query regarding rewards. However, it completely fails to capture the subsequent explicit requests from the user: asking for a 'discount code' and requesting it 'as a QR code'. No variables reflect these critical pieces of information or the user's evolving intent, indicating a major error in parsing and storing information from the user's input.
- [Score: 0.0] The AI failed to parse and store any information from the user's prompt into the session state. The provided state contains only customer profile data and internal metadata, none of which reflect the 15% discount request, competitor coupon, or the intent to apply it to the cart, or the explicit lack of information regarding purchase or QR code.
- [Score: 0.0] The AI completely failed to extract and store any of the critical information from the user's prompt, such as the requested service type, date (2024-07-29), or time slot (9 AM - 12 PM). The provided state consists solely of a static customer profile and internal timestamps, with 'scheduled_appointments' remaining empty, indicating no parsing or capture of the user's request.

## Metric: `trajectory_accuracy`
**Average Score:** 1.6000
**Sample Explanations:**
- [Score: 1.0] Key sub-agents for inventory management and shopping cart operations were completely skipped. Instead, a generic 'customer_service' agent was invoked three times, for two distinct actionable requests and one conversational context, leading to major deviations from the expected specific agent calls and an extra, unnecessary call.
- [Score: 0.0] The AI's trajectory uses a generic 'customer_service' agent for all steps, completely missing the specific tools required for the user's requests such as a 'video_call' tool, a 'knowledge_base' or 'plant_care_tool' for instructions, and an 'email_tool' for sending them. The trajectory is entirely different from the expected sequence of specialized agent calls.
- [Score: 5.0] The agent correctly identified that all three user requests, spanning across three conversational turns, fall under the 'customer_service' domain. The sequence of calls perfectly matches the conversational flow, addressing each query sequentially and appropriately. No steps were missed, and there were no unnecessary or hallucinated steps.
- [Score: 2.0] The agent correctly identified 'customer_service' as the appropriate tool for a competitor price match and discount application. However, it repeated the 'customer_service' call three times, which is redundant and constitutes unnecessary extra steps, moving it from a minor deviation to a more significant one.
- [Score: 0.0] The agent repeatedly called a single, generic 'customer_service' sub-agent, failing to decompose the user's multi-step request into specific actions like checking availability and scheduling appointments. This trajectory is completely different from what would be expected for such a task, and key functional steps are either skipped or obscured.

## Metric: `response_correctness`
**Average Score:** 0.7714
**Sample Explanations:**
- [Score: 0.5] 
- [Score: 0.6666667] 
- [Score: 0.8333333] 
- [Score: 0.85714287] 
- [Score: 1.0] 

## Metric: `tool_usage_accuracy`
**Average Score:** 0.6000
**Sample Explanations:**
- [Score: 0.0] The AI understood the user's intent to check stock and add to cart, and it responded conversationally as if these actions were performed. However, no actual tool calls (e.g., `check_product_stock`, `add_to_cart`) were outputted in the provided response, meaning no tools were used when they were clearly needed to fulfill the user's requests.
- [Score: 0.0] The AI-generated response contains only `text_response` objects and no explicit tool calls (e.g., `tool_code` or `tool_code_result`). While the agent's text implies that tools were used (to send a video call link and an email), the actual tool calls are not present in the provided output, making it impossible to assess their necessity, correctness, or effectiveness directly. As tools were needed but no tool calls are shown, this aligns with '0: No tools used when needed'.
- [Score: 0.0] The user's requests required tool calls to retrieve loyalty points, generate a discount code, and create a QR code. However, the AI-generated response only contains text responses and does not show any tool calls being made, despite simulating the outcomes of such calls. This indicates no tools were used when they were needed.
- [Score: 0.0] The user's prompt explicitly requested to apply a discount to the cart, and the agent's text responses clearly indicate that it performed actions requiring tool calls (e.g., retrieving cart details and applying a discount). However, the provided 'AI-generated Response' only contains text responses and does not log any actual tool calls. Therefore, based on the provided output, no tools were used or logged when they were clearly necessary to fulfill the user's request, constituting a critical failure.
- [Score: 3.0] The agent correctly identified the need for scheduling and information retrieval tools. The implicit tool calls for getting available slots and scheduling the appointment were made with correct arguments and successfully achieved the user's goal. However, the agent exhibited a minor efficiency issue by explicitly asking the user for the date ('what date are you looking to have the trees planted?') even though the date (2024-07-29) was clearly provided within the initial user prompt. This created an unnecessary conversational turn. Despite this, the agent then correctly used the provided date to fetch and present the available slots and to schedule the appointment. The additional actions (discount, instructions) were effective and value-adding.
