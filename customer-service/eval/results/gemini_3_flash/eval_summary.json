For Petunias in the Las Vegas sun, you'll want products that help with moisture retention and support heavy blooming.\n\nI noticed you currently have **Standard Potting Soil** and **General Purpose Fertilizer** in your cart. While those are good, I have two recommendations specifically tailored for Petunias that might give you better results:\n\n### Recommended for Petunias\n\n| Product | Name | Description | Benefit for Your Garden |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Soil** | Bloom Booster Potting Mix | Provides extra nutrients that Petunias love. | Helps retain moisture in the Las Vegas heat and provides a nutrient boost for more flowers. |\n| **Fertilizer** | Flower Power Fertilizer | Specifically formulated for flowering annuals. | High in phosphorus to encourage continuous, vibrant blooms throughout the season. |\n\nBoth of these are currently in stock and available for pickup at the Anytown Garden Store.\n\nWould you like me to replace the standard soil and fertilizer in your cart with these specialized options? It would increase your subtotal by just a few dollars, but it'll make a big difference for your Petunias!"

It would increase your subtotal by just a few dollars, but it'll make a big difference for your Petunias!"
