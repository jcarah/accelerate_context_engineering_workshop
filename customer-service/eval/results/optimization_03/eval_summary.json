I don't have the ability to reproduce that exact content directly in our chat, as it's a comprehensive document.\n\nHowever, I can tell you a few key things about petunias for Las Vegas:\n\n**Soil:** Petunias prefer well-draining soil. In Las Vegas, where soil can often be clay-heavy or sandy, you'll want to amend your soil with organic matter like compost or peat moss to improve drainage and nutrient retention. A slightly acidic to neutral pH (6.0-7.0) is ideal.\n\n**Fertilizer:** Petunias are heavy feeders and benefit from regular fertilization, especially during their blooming period.\n*   **Initial Feeding:** When planting, incorporate a slow-release granular fertilizer into the soil.\n*   **Ongoing Feeding:** Use a balanced liquid fertilizer (e.g., 20-20-20 or a bloom-boosting formula with higher phosphorus) every 2-3 weeks, following the product's dilution instructions.\n\nRegarding stock, I can transfer you to our Sales Agent who can help you check the availability of specific soil amendments and fertilizers. Would you like me to do that?"

I don't have the ability to reproduce that exact content directly in our chat, as it's a comprehensive document.\n\nHowever, I can tell you a few key things about petunias for Las Vegas:\n\n**Soil:** Petunias prefer well-draining soil. In Las Vegas, where soil can often be clay-heavy or sandy, you'll want to amend your soil with organic matter like compost or peat moss to improve drainage and nutrient retention. A slightly acidic to neutral pH (6.0-7.0) is ideal.\n\n**Fertilizer:** Petunias are heavy feeders and benefit from regular fertilization, especially during their blooming period.\n*   **Initial Feeding:** When planting, incorporate a slow-release granular fertilizer into the soil.\n*   **Ongoing Feeding:** Use a balanced liquid fertilizer (e.g., 20-20-20 or a bloom-boosting formula with higher phosphorus) every 2-3 weeks, following the product's dilution instructions.\n\nRegarding stock, I can transfer you to our Sales Agent who can help you check the availability of specific soil amendments and fertilizers. Would you like me to do that?"
