Growing Petunias in Las Vegas is a wonderful idea, though they'll definitely need some extra care to thrive in the desert heat!\n\nSince you have a medium-sized backyard with full sun exposure, Petunias will love the light, but you'll want to ensure they stay well-hydrated. I noticed you already have **Standard Potting Soil** and **General Purpose Fertilizer** in your cart. For the best results with Petunias, I recommend:\n\n*   **Bloom Booster Potting Mix:** This helps with water retention, which is crucial in our climate.\n*   **Flower Power Fertilizer:** This is specifically formulated to keep those blooms vibrant.\n\nWould you like me to check the availability of specific Petunia varieties at your local store, or perhaps look into scheduling a professional planting service to help get them established?"

I noticed you already have **Standard Potting Soil** and **General Purpose Fertilizer** in your cart.
