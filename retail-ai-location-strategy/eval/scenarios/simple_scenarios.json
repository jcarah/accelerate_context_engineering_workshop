    {
      "starting_prompt": "I want to open a generic retail store in Manhattan, NY. I need you to find at least 50 specific competitors, list their exact addresses and ratings, and then calculate the average rating of the top 10 versus the bottom 10.",
      "conversation_plan": "Ask for the massive list of competitors. If the agent tries to summarize, refuse and demand the full list of 50 addresses and the manual calculation."
    },
    {
      "starting_prompt": "I want to open a coffee shop. Compare Indiranagar, Koramangala, and HSR Layout in Bangalore simultaneously.",
      "conversation_plan": "Request a side-by-side comparison of the three neighborhoods. After the initial analysis, press the agent to declare a clear winner based on foot traffic."
    },
    {
      "starting_prompt": "Analyze a 'Quiet Library' in the middle of Times Square, NY.",
      "conversation_plan": "Propose the 'Quiet Library' idea. When the agent raises concerns about noise, admit the issue but ask if soundproofing could solve it and make the project viable."

    {
      "starting_prompt": "Generate an infographic for a high-end luxury watch store in Zurich. I want the data to include specific foot traffic numbers and competitor revenue estimates.",
      "conversation_plan": "Order the infographic with specific data requirements. Once generated, question the source of the data to verify it came from the research phase."

    {
      "starting_prompt": "I have a prime spot in Austin, Texas. Run a full feasibility study for four completely different concepts: a High-End Gym, a Drive-Thru Coffee Stand, a Pet Grooming Salon, and a Vintage Clothing Store. I need a decision by 5 PM.",
      "conversation_plan": "Submit the four distinct concepts for analysis. Once the feasibility reports are in, ask the agent to force rank them and pick the single best option."
