You are an expert AI evaluation analyst. Your task is to produce a deep technical diagnosis of an AI agent's performance. You MUST base your analysis exclusively on the context provided below.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  **Focus on Diagnosis, Not Recommendations:** Your primary goal is to explain *why* the metrics are what they are. Do not provide a future-looking action plan or make recommendations about business decisions. Stick to a root cause analysis of the current state.
2.  **Synthesize, Don't Summarize:** Do not simply repeat the scores. Your value is in synthesizing insights by connecting the metric scores, the metric definitions, the source code, and the raw explanations.
3.  **Reference Your Sources:** When you make a claim or analyze a metric, you MUST reference the specific source file (e.g., `metric_definitions.json`, `deterministic_metrics.py`, `agent.py`).
4.  **Analyze Calculation Methods:** For each metric you discuss, you MUST explain how its calculation method (deterministic vs. LLM-judged) influences its interpretation.
5.  **CRITICAL: Diagnose the Evaluation Itself:** Your analysis is not limited to the agent's code. You MUST also diagnose potential flaws in the evaluation setup. If a metric score seems incorrect or misleading, investigate the interaction between the question's metadata, the agent's expected behavior, and the metric's calculation logic.

---

**Technical Performance Diagnosis**

*   **Objective:** Provide a detailed root cause analysis of the agent's performance by linking metric scores to the agent's underlying source code, prompts, and execution logic. This includes identifying when low scores are caused by flaws in the evaluation methodology itself.

*   **Structure:**
    1.  **Overall Performance Summary:** Briefly state the agent's key strengths and weaknesses, supported by 2-3 primary metrics. Highlight any metrics that may be misleading due to evaluation flaws.
    2.  **Deep Dive Diagnosis:** For each major finding, present a detailed hypothesis.
        *   **Finding:** State the observation.
        *   **Supporting Metrics:** List the specific metrics and scores that support this finding.
        *   **Root Cause Hypothesis:** Provide a detailed, evidence-based hypothesis connecting the metric, the source code, and the evaluation data.

---

**Context for Your Analysis**

You are provided with the following context files to perform your diagnosis. Use them to connect the agent's behavior (the metrics) to its underlying implementation (the code).

**1. Overall Performance Data:**
*   **Evaluation Summary:** High-level average scores for all metrics. Use this to identify the most significant areas of success and failure.

Overview\n*   **Target Location:** Austin, Texas\n*   **Business Type:** fitness studio\n*   **Analysis Date:** 2026-01-14\n*   **Market Validation:** Austin is a strong and promising market for a new fitness studio, driven by a young, affluent, and health-conscious population. However, the market is mature and highly competitive, necessitating a strategic niche positioning and a differentiated, premium experience to succeed.\n\n### 2. Top Recommendation: Zone 6 - Far North/Northwest\n*   **Area:** Arboretum, Great Hills (ZIPs 78759, 78731)\n*   **Overall Score:** 73\n*   **Opportunity Type:** Residential Sticky / Premium Gap\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Low Competitive Saturation:** This zone has the most favorable balance of high demand and low competition. Evidence: Lowest Market Saturation Index (11.05) in the quantitative analysis.\n    *   **High Demand & Purchasing Power:** The area is characterized by high-income households with significant discretionary spending. Evidence: Joint-highest Demand Signal score (2.6) driven by high income and population growth.\n    *   **Clear Market Gap:** The market is dominated by large, traditional gyms, leaving a distinct opening for a high-end, community-focused boutique studio.\n*   **Concerns & Mitigations:**\n    *   **Risk: Moderate Rental Costs.** Mitigation: Prioritize locations in high-visibility retail centers (e.g., The Arboretum) to maximize marketing ROI and assume Tier 2 rental rates in financial plans.\n    *   **Risk: Car-Dependent Customer Base.** Mitigation: Select a location with ample, accessible parking and design a class schedule that caters to commuter patterns and local work schedules.\n\n### 3. Key Metrics for Top Recommendation (Zone 6)\n*   **Competition:** 3 Total Competitors, 100% Chain Dominance, 4.37 Avg. Rating.\n*   **Market:** Moderate Population Density, High Income Level, Excellent Infrastructure Access.\n*   **Best Customer Segment:** Affluent Suburban Tech Families.\n*   **Estimated Foot Traffic:** High-intent, destination-based traffic, with peaks during evenings and weekends.\n\n### 4. Actionable Next Steps\n*   Scout commercial real estate in or adjacent to The Arboretum, Great Hills, and The Grove.\n*   Finalize a premium, multi-disciplinary studio concept (e.g., HIIT, Reformer Pilates, Yoga).\n*   Conduct primary research with the 'Affluent Suburban Tech Families' segment to validate offerings and price points.\n*   Develop a pre-launch marketing strategy targeting employees of major North Austin tech campuses.\n*   Build a comprehensive financial model based on Tier 2 rental costs and premium membership pricing.\n\n### 5. Alternative Locations\n*   **Zone 3: East Austin (Score: 78):** Strong preference for independent brands but the market is rapidly maturing and becoming saturated.\n*   **Zone 1: Central Core (Score: 65):** Unmatched demand signals but extremely high market saturation and the highest rental costs in the city.\n*   **Zone 5: South Austin (Score: 41):** Low competition and lower rental costs, but significantly lower demand and purchasing power, making it a poor fit for a premium concept.\n\n### 6. Key Strategic Insights\n*   Austin's fitness market is bifurcated between hyper-saturated urban cores and underserved, affluent suburban corridors.\n*   Success is contingent on niche positioning; a generic 'gym' offering will likely fail.\n*   The market supports premium pricing but demands a flawless customer experience (many competitors have 4.8+ star ratings).\n*   Real estate costs are a primary barrier in central zones, making a balanced strategy in Tier 2 rental areas more viable.\n\n### 7. Methodology Summary\nThis recommendation integrates qualitative market research, comprehensive competitor mapping of over 30 businesses, and a quantitative gap analysis. A weighted scoring model was used to rank 6 strategic zones based on demand signals, market saturation, infrastructure, and costs to identify the optimal balance of opportunity and risk."

Top Recommendation: Zone 6 - Far North/Northwest\n*   **Area:** Arboretum, Great Hills (ZIPs 78759, 78731)\n*   **Overall Score:** 73\n*   **Opportunity Type:** Residential Sticky / Premium Gap\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Low Competitive Saturation:** This zone has the most favorable balance of high demand and low competition. Evidence: Lowest Market Saturation Index (11.05) in the quantitative analysis.\n    *   **High Demand & Purchasing Power:** The area is characterized by high-income households with significant discretionary spending. Evidence: Joint-highest Demand Signal score (2.6) driven by high income and population growth.\n    *   **Clear Market Gap:** The market is dominated by large, traditional gyms, leaving a distinct opening for a high-end, community-focused boutique studio.\n*   **Concerns & Mitigations:**\n    *   **Risk: Moderate Rental Costs.** Mitigation: Prioritize locations in high-visibility retail centers (e.g., The Arboretum) to maximize marketing ROI and assume Tier 2 rental rates in financial plans.\n    *   **Risk: Car-Dependent Customer Base.** Mitigation: Select a location with ample, accessible parking and design a class schedule that caters to commuter patterns and local work schedules.\n\n### 3. Key Metrics for Top Recommendation (Zone 6)\n*   **Competition:** 3 Total Competitors, 100% Chain Dominance, 4.37 Avg. Rating.\n*   **Market:** Moderate Population Density, High Income Level, Excellent Infrastructure Access.\n*   **Best Customer Segment:** Affluent Suburban Tech Families.\n*   **Estimated Foot Traffic:** High-intent, destination-based traffic, with peaks during evenings and weekends.\n\n### 4. Actionable Next Steps\n*   Scout commercial real estate in or adjacent to The Arboretum, Great Hills, and The Grove.\n*   Finalize a premium, multi-disciplinary studio concept (e.g., HIIT, Reformer Pilates, Yoga).\n*   Conduct primary research with the 'Affluent Suburban Tech Families' segment to validate offerings and price points.\n*   Develop a pre-launch marketing strategy targeting employees of major North Austin tech campuses.\n*   Build a comprehensive financial model based on Tier 2 rental costs and premium membership pricing.\n\n### 5. Alternative Locations\n*   **Zone 3: East Austin (Score: 78):** Strong preference for independent brands but the market is rapidly maturing and becoming saturated.\n*   **Zone 1: Central Core (Score: 65):** Unmatched demand signals but extremely high market saturation and the highest rental costs in the city.\n*   **Zone 5: South Austin (Score: 41):** Low competition and lower rental costs, but significantly lower demand and purchasing power, making it a poor fit for a premium concept.\n\n### 6. Key Strategic Insights\n*   Austin's fitness market is bifurcated between hyper-saturated urban cores and underserved, affluent suburban corridors.\n*   Success is contingent on niche positioning; a generic 'gym' offering will likely fail.\n*   The market supports premium pricing but demands a flawless customer experience (many competitors have 4.8+ star ratings).\n*   Real estate costs are a primary barrier in central zones, making a balanced strategy in Tier 2 rental areas more viable.\n\n### 7. Methodology Summary\nThis recommendation integrates qualitative market research, comprehensive competitor mapping of over 30 businesses, and a quantitative gap analysis. A weighted scoring model was used to rank 6 strategic zones based on demand signals, market saturation, infrastructure, and costs to identify the optimal balance of opportunity and risk."

                          "reportData": "## Strategic Location Analysis: Fitness Studio in Austin, Texas\n\n### 1. Overview\n*   **Target Location:** Austin, Texas\n*   **Business Type:** fitness studio\n*   **Analysis Date:** 2026-01-14\n*   **Market Validation:** Austin is a strong and promising market for a new fitness studio, driven by a young, affluent, and health-conscious population. However, the market is mature and highly competitive, necessitating a strategic niche positioning and a differentiated, premium experience to succeed.\n\n### 2. Top Recommendation: Zone 6 - Far North/Northwest\n*   **Area:** Arboretum, Great Hills (ZIPs 78759, 78731)\n*   **Overall Score:** 73\n*   **Opportunity Type:** Residential Sticky / Premium Gap\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Low Competitive Saturation:** This zone has the most favorable balance of high demand and low competition. Evidence: Lowest Market Saturation Index (11.05) in the quantitative analysis.\n    *   **High Demand & Purchasing Power:** The area is characterized by high-income households with significant discretionary spending. Evidence: Joint-highest Demand Signal score (2.6) driven by high income and population growth.\n    *   **Clear Market Gap:** The market is dominated by large, traditional gyms, leaving a distinct opening for a high-end, community-focused boutique studio.\n*   **Concerns & Mitigations:**\n    *   **Risk: Moderate Rental Costs.** Mitigation: Prioritize locations in high-visibility retail centers (e.g., The Arboretum) to maximize marketing ROI and assume Tier 2 rental rates in financial plans.\n    *   **Risk: Car-Dependent Customer Base.** Mitigation: Select a location with ample, accessible parking and design a class schedule that caters to commuter patterns and local work schedules.\n\n### 3. Key Metrics for Top Recommendation (Zone 6)\n*   **Competition:** 3 Total Competitors, 100% Chain Dominance, 4.37 Avg. Rating.\n*   **Market:** Moderate Population Density, High Income Level, Excellent Infrastructure Access.\n*   **Best Customer Segment:** Affluent Suburban Tech Families.\n*   **Estimated Foot Traffic:** High-intent, destination-based traffic, with peaks during evenings and weekends.\n\n### 4. Actionable Next Steps\n*   Scout commercial real estate in or adjacent to The Arboretum, Great Hills, and The Grove.\n*   Finalize a premium, multi-disciplinary studio concept (e.g., HIIT, Reformer Pilates, Yoga).\n*   Conduct primary research with the 'Affluent Suburban Tech Families' segment to validate offerings and price points.\n*   Develop a pre-launch marketing strategy targeting employees of major North Austin tech campuses.\n*   Build a comprehensive financial model based on Tier 2 rental costs and premium membership pricing.\n\n### 5. Alternative Locations\n*   **Zone 3: East Austin (Score: 78):** Strong preference for independent brands but the market is rapidly maturing and becoming saturated.\n*   **Zone 1: Central Core (Score: 65):** Unmatched demand signals but extremely high market saturation and the highest rental costs in the city.\n*   **Zone 5: South Austin (Score: 41):** Low competition and lower rental costs, but significantly lower demand and purchasing power, making it a poor fit for a premium concept.\n\n### 6. Key Strategic Insights\n*   Austin's fitness market is bifurcated between hyper-saturated urban cores and underserved, affluent suburban corridors.\n*   Success is contingent on niche positioning; a generic 'gym' offering will likely fail.\n*   The market supports premium pricing but demands a flawless customer experience (many competitors have 4.8+ star ratings).\n*   Real estate costs are a primary barrier in central zones, making a balanced strategy in Tier 2 rental areas more viable.\n\n### 7. Methodology Summary\nThis recommendation integrates qualitative market research, comprehensive competitor mapping of over 30 businesses, and a quantitative gap analysis. A weighted scoring model was used to rank 6 strategic zones based on demand signals, market saturation, infrastructure, and costs to identify the optimal balance of opportunity and risk."

It offers a near-perfect demographic of affluent, young professionals with high purchasing power and is experiencing sustained growth. However, the market is extremely saturated with high-quality competitors, and the primary barrier to entry is the exceptionally high commercial rental cost, demanding a clear differentiation strategy and robust financial planning for success.\n\n### Top Recommendation: Sparse Zones (Residential)\n*   **Location Name:** Sparse Zones (Residential)\n*   **Overall Score:** 85\n*   **Opportunity Type:** Destination Neighborhood Cafe\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Lower Rental Costs:** Significantly lower rental costs compared to main commercial roads, improving financial viability.\n    *   **Low Chain Dominance:** An environment receptive to unique, independent brands (only 14% chain dominance).\n    *   **Reduced Direct Competition:** Fewer direct competitors allow for the creation of a local hub.\n*   **Concerns:**\n    *   **High Quality Threshold:** Existing competitors are exceptionally high-performing (e.g., Neon Market at 4.8 stars), setting a high bar.\n    *   **Lower Incidental Foot Traffic:** The business must become a 'destination' that customers actively seek out.\n\n### Competition Snapshot (Sparse Zones)\n*   **Total Competitors in Zone:** 7\n*   **Density:** 4.67 per km\u00b2\n*   **Chain Dominance:** 14.0%\n*   **Average Competitor Rating:** 4.43\n*   **High Performers (>4.5 stars):** 2\n\n### Market Characteristics (Sparse Zones)\n*   **Population Density:** High\n*   **Income Level:** High\n*   **Infrastructure Access:** Good\n*   **Foot Traffic Pattern:** Primarily residential-driven, consistent local traffic.\n*   **Rental Cost Tier:** Medium\n\n### Alternative Locations\n1.  **CMH Road (Score: 85):**\n    *   **Opportunity:** High-Traffic Differentiator\n    *   **Strength:** High and consistent demand from metro commuters and dense population.\n    *   **Concern:** High chain dominance (50%), requiring direct competition with established brands.\n    *   **Why Not Top:** Presents higher risk and investment for a new independent brand due to strong chain presence.\n2.  **12th Main Road Corridor (Score: 81):**\n    *   **Opportunity:** Boutique Experience Hub\n    *   **Strength:** Extremely high foot traffic from shoppers and diners.\n    *   **Concern:** Extreme market saturation and very high investment required.\n    *   **Why Not Top:** Financially precarious for a new entrant without significant funding and a revolutionary concept.\n\n### Recommended Next Steps\n1.  **Scout Properties:** Focus on secondary streets like 7th, 9th, or 11th Main.\n2.  **Develop Unique Concept:** Create a specific, differentiated offering (e.g., artisanal patisserie, specialty tea).\n3.  **Financial Modeling:** Create a detailed financial model based on medium rental costs and secure 9+ months of operating capital.\n4.  **Pre-Launch Marketing:** Build a strong Instagram and local community presence to generate buzz.\n5.  **Community Engagement:** Plan a calendar of events (workshops, live music) to establish the cafe as a neighborhood hub.\n\n### Key Strategic Insights\n*   **High Quality Floor:** Excellence in product and service is a baseline requirement; no competitors rate below 4.0.\n*   **Universal Saturation:** The strategic choice is not if, but what kind of saturation to compete in.\n*   **Financial Barrier:** High rental costs are the primary barrier to entry.\n*   **Brand Identity is Crucial:** Every successful player has a strong, clear value proposition.\n*   **Marketing is Non-Negotiable:** A passive 'build it and they will come' strategy will fail.\n*   **Two Viable Paths:** Become a 'destination neighborhood cafe' or a 'differentiated competitor' in a high-traffic zone.\n\n### Methodology\nThis report synthesizes market research, a real-time analysis of 24 competitors, and a quantitative gap analysis that scored four commercial zones on metrics including demand, competition, and cost factors."

It offers a near-perfect demographic of affluent, young professionals with high purchasing power and is experiencing sustained growth. However, the market is extremely saturated with high-quality competitors, and the primary barrier to entry is the exceptionally high commercial rental cost, demanding a clear differentiation strategy and robust financial planning for success.\n\n### Top Recommendation: Sparse Zones (Residential)\n*   **Location Name:** Sparse Zones (Residential)\n*   **Overall Score:** 85\n*   **Opportunity Type:** Destination Neighborhood Cafe\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Lower Rental Costs:** Significantly lower rental costs compared to main commercial roads, improving financial viability.\n    *   **Low Chain Dominance:** An environment receptive to unique, independent brands (only 14% chain dominance).\n    *   **Reduced Direct Competition:** Fewer direct competitors allow for the creation of a local hub.\n*   **Concerns:**\n    *   **High Quality Threshold:** Existing competitors are exceptionally high-performing (e.g., Neon Market at 4.8 stars), setting a high bar.\n    *   **Lower Incidental Foot Traffic:** The business must become a 'destination' that customers actively seek out.\n\n### Competition Snapshot (Sparse Zones)\n*   **Total Competitors in Zone:** 7\n*   **Density:** 4.67 per km\u00b2\n*   **Chain Dominance:** 14.0%\n*   **Average Competitor Rating:** 4.43\n*   **High Performers (>4.5 stars):** 2\n\n### Market Characteristics (Sparse Zones)\n*   **Population Density:** High\n*   **Income Level:** High\n*   **Infrastructure Access:** Good\n*   **Foot Traffic Pattern:** Primarily residential-driven, consistent local traffic.\n*   **Rental Cost Tier:** Medium\n\n### Alternative Locations\n1.  **CMH Road (Score: 85):**\n    *   **Opportunity:** High-Traffic Differentiator\n    *   **Strength:** High and consistent demand from metro commuters and dense population.\n    *   **Concern:** High chain dominance (50%), requiring direct competition with established brands.\n    *   **Why Not Top:** Presents higher risk and investment for a new independent brand due to strong chain presence.\n2.  **12th Main Road Corridor (Score: 81):**\n    *   **Opportunity:** Boutique Experience Hub\n    *   **Strength:** Extremely high foot traffic from shoppers and diners.\n    *   **Concern:** Extreme market saturation and very high investment required.\n    *   **Why Not Top:** Financially precarious for a new entrant without significant funding and a revolutionary concept.\n\n### Recommended Next Steps\n1.  **Scout Properties:** Focus on secondary streets like 7th, 9th, or 11th Main.\n2.  **Develop Unique Concept:** Create a specific, differentiated offering (e.g., artisanal patisserie, specialty tea).\n3.  **Financial Modeling:** Create a detailed financial model based on medium rental costs and secure 9+ months of operating capital.\n4.  **Pre-Launch Marketing:** Build a strong Instagram and local community presence to generate buzz.\n5.  **Community Engagement:** Plan a calendar of events (workshops, live music) to establish the cafe as a neighborhood hub.\n\n### Key Strategic Insights\n*   **High Quality Floor:** Excellence in product and service is a baseline requirement; no competitors rate below 4.0.\n*   **Universal Saturation:** The strategic choice is not if, but what kind of saturation to compete in.\n*   **Financial Barrier:** High rental costs are the primary barrier to entry.\n*   **Brand Identity is Crucial:** Every successful player has a strong, clear value proposition.\n*   **Marketing is Non-Negotiable:** A passive 'build it and they will come' strategy will fail.\n*   **Two Viable Paths:** Become a 'destination neighborhood cafe' or a 'differentiated competitor' in a high-traffic zone.\n\n### Methodology\nThis report synthesizes market research, a real-time analysis of 24 competitors, and a quantitative gap analysis that scored four commercial zones on metrics including demand, competition, and cost factors."

It offers a near-perfect demographic of affluent, young professionals with high purchasing power and is experiencing sustained growth. However, the market is extremely saturated with high-quality competitors, and the primary barrier to entry is the exceptionally high commercial rental cost, demanding a clear differentiation strategy and robust financial planning for success.\n\n### Top Recommendation: Sparse Zones (Residential)\n*   **Location Name:** Sparse Zones (Residential)\n*   **Overall Score:** 85\n*   **Opportunity Type:** Destination Neighborhood Cafe\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Lower Rental Costs:** Significantly lower rental costs compared to main commercial roads, improving financial viability.\n    *   **Low Chain Dominance:** An environment receptive to unique, independent brands (only 14% chain dominance).\n    *   **Reduced Direct Competition:** Fewer direct competitors allow for the creation of a local hub.\n*   **Concerns:**\n    *   **High Quality Threshold:** Existing competitors are exceptionally high-performing (e.g., Neon Market at 4.8 stars), setting a high bar.\n    *   **Lower Incidental Foot Traffic:** The business must become a 'destination' that customers actively seek out.\n\n### Competition Snapshot (Sparse Zones)\n*   **Total Competitors in Zone:** 7\n*   **Density:** 4.67 per km\u00b2\n*   **Chain Dominance:** 14.0%\n*   **Average Competitor Rating:** 4.43\n*   **High Performers (>4.5 stars):** 2\n\n### Market Characteristics (Sparse Zones)\n*   **Population Density:** High\n*   **Income Level:** High\n*   **Infrastructure Access:** Good\n*   **Foot Traffic Pattern:** Primarily residential-driven, consistent local traffic.\n*   **Rental Cost Tier:** Medium\n\n### Alternative Locations\n1.  **CMH Road (Score: 85):**\n    *   **Opportunity:** High-Traffic Differentiator\n    *   **Strength:** High and consistent demand from metro commuters and dense population.\n    *   **Concern:** High chain dominance (50%), requiring direct competition with established brands.\n    *   **Why Not Top:** Presents higher risk and investment for a new independent brand due to strong chain presence.\n2.  **12th Main Road Corridor (Score: 81):**\n    *   **Opportunity:** Boutique Experience Hub\n    *   **Strength:** Extremely high foot traffic from shoppers and diners.\n    *   **Concern:** Extreme market saturation and very high investment required.\n    *   **Why Not Top:** Financially precarious for a new entrant without significant funding and a revolutionary concept.\n\n### Recommended Next Steps\n1.  **Scout Properties:** Focus on secondary streets like 7th, 9th, or 11th Main.\n2.  **Develop Unique Concept:** Create a specific, differentiated offering (e.g., artisanal patisserie, specialty tea).\n3.  **Financial Modeling:** Create a detailed financial model based on medium rental costs and secure 9+ months of operating capital.\n4.  **Pre-Launch Marketing:** Build a strong Instagram and local community presence to generate buzz.\n5.  **Community Engagement:** Plan a calendar of events (workshops, live music) to establish the cafe as a neighborhood hub.\n\n### Key Strategic Insights\n*   **High Quality Floor:** Excellence in product and service is a baseline requirement; no competitors rate below 4.0.\n*   **Universal Saturation:** The strategic choice is not if, but what kind of saturation to compete in.\n*   **Financial Barrier:** High rental costs are the primary barrier to entry.\n*   **Brand Identity is Crucial:** Every successful player has a strong, clear value proposition.\n*   **Marketing is Non-Negotiable:** A passive 'build it and they will come' strategy will fail.\n*   **Two Viable Paths:** Become a 'destination neighborhood cafe' or a 'differentiated competitor' in a high-traffic zone.\n\n### Methodology\nThis report synthesizes market research, a real-time analysis of 24 competitors, and a quantitative gap analysis that scored four commercial zones on metrics including demand, competition, and cost factors."

"""Retail Location Strategy Agent - Root Agent Definition.

This module defines the root agent for the Location Strategy Pipeline.
It uses a SequentialAgent to orchestrate 6 specialized sub-agents:

1. MarketResearchAgent - Live web research with Google Search
2. CompetitorMappingAgent - Competitor mapping with Maps Places API
3. GapAnalysisAgent - Quantitative analysis with Python code execution
4. StrategyAdvisorAgent - Strategic synthesis with extended reasoning
5. ReportGeneratorAgent - HTML executive report generation
6. InfographicGeneratorAgent - Visual infographic generation

The pipeline analyzes a target location for a specific business type and
produces comprehensive location intelligence including recommendations,
an HTML report, and an infographic.

Authentication:
    Uses Google AI Studio (API key) instead of Vertex AI.
    Set environment variables:
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key
        GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
        MAPS_API_KEY=your_maps_api_key

Usage:
    Run with: adk web retail_ai_location_strategy_adk

    The agent expects initial state variables:
    - target_location: The geographic area to analyze (e.g., "Bangalore, India")
    - business_type: Type of business to open (e.g., "coffee shop")

    Optional state variables:
    - maps_api_key: Google Maps API key for Places search

## Available Data

### MARKET RESEARCH FINDINGS (Part 1):
{market_research_findings}

### COMPETITOR ANALYSIS (Part 2):
{competitor_analysis}

## Your Mission
Write and execute Python code to perform comprehensive quantitative analysis.

## Analysis Steps

### Step 1: Parse Competitor Data
Extract from the competitor analysis:
- Competitor names and locations
- Ratings and review counts
- Zone/area classifications
- Business types (chain vs independent)

### Step 2: Extract Market Fundamentals
From the market research:
- Population estimates
- Income levels (assign numeric scores)
- Infrastructure quality indicators
- Foot traffic patterns

### Step 3: Calculate Zone Metrics
For each identified zone, compute:

**Basic Metrics:**
- Competitor count
- Competitor density (per estimated area)
- Average competitor rating
- Total review volume

**Quality Metrics:**
- Competition Quality Score: Weighted by ratings (4.5+ = high threat)
- Chain Dominance Ratio: % of chain/franchise competitors
- High Performer Count: Number of 4.5+ rated competitors

**Opportunity Metrics:**
- Demand Signal: Based on population, income, infrastructure
- Market Saturation Index: (Competitors × Quality) / Demand
- Viability Score: Multi-factor weighted score

### Step 4: Zone Categorization
Classify each zone as:
- **SATURATED**: High competition, low opportunity
- **MODERATE**: Balanced market, moderate opportunity
- **OPPORTUNITY**: Low competition, high potential

Also assign:
- Risk Level: Low / Medium / High
- Investment Tier: Based on expected costs
- Best Customer Segment: Target demographic

### Step 5: Rank Top Zones
Create a weighted ranking considering:
- Low market saturation (weight: 30%)
- High demand signals (weight: 30%)
- Low chain dominance (weight: 15%)
- Infrastructure quality (weight: 15%)
- Manageable costs (weight: 10%)

### Step 6: Output Tables
Generate clear output tables showing:
1. All zones with computed metrics
2. Top 3 recommended zones with scores
3. Risk assessment matrix

## Code Guidelines
- Use pandas for data manipulation
- Print all results clearly formatted
- Include intermediate calculations for transparency
- Handle missing data gracefully

Execute the code and provide actionable strategic recommendations based on the quantitative findings.

TARGET LOCATION: {target_location}
BUSINESS TYPE: {business_type}
CURRENT DATE: {current_date}

## Strategic Report Data
{strategic_report}

## Your Mission
Create a compelling infographic that visually summarizes the key findings from the analysis.

## Steps

### Step 1: Extract Key Data Points
From the strategic report, identify:
- Target location and business type
- Top recommended location with score
- Total competitors found
- Number of zones analyzed
- 3-5 key strategic insights
- Top strengths and concerns
- Market validation verdict

### Step 2: Create Data Summary
Compose a concise data summary suitable for visualization:

**FORMAT YOUR SUMMARY AS:**

LOCATION INTELLIGENCE REPORT: [Business Type] in [Target Location]
Analysis Date: [Date]

TOP RECOMMENDATION:
[Location Name] - Score: [XX]/100
Type: [Opportunity Type]

KEY METRICS:
- Total Competitors: [X]
- Zones Analyzed: [X]
- Market Status: [Validated/Cautionary]

TOP STRENGTHS:
1. [Strength 1]
2. [Strength 2]
3. [Strength 3]

KEY INSIGHTS:
- [Insight 1]
- [Insight 2]
- [Insight 3]

VERDICT: [One-line market recommendation]

### Step 3: Generate Infographic
Call the generate_infographic tool with your data summary.

### Step 4: Report Result
After the tool returns, store the result for the callback to process.
If successful, confirm the infographic was generated.
If failed, report the error for troubleshooting.

## Output
The generate_infographic tool will return a result dict containing:
- status: "success" or "error"
- image_data: Base64 encoded PNG (if successful)
- error_message: Error details (if failed)

Store this result so the after_agent_callback can save the artifact.

Your task is to map and analyze all competitors in the target area using real Google Maps data.

TARGET LOCATION: {target_location}
BUSINESS TYPE: {business_type}
CURRENT DATE: {current_date}

## Your Mission
Use the search_places function to get REAL data from Google Maps about existing competitors.

## Step 1: Search for Competitors
Call the search_places function with queries like:
- "{business_type} near {target_location}"
- Related business types in the same area

## Step 2: Analyze the Results
For each competitor found, note:
- Business name
- Location/address
- Rating (out of 5)
- Number of reviews
- Business status (operational, etc.)

## Step 3: Identify Patterns
Analyze the competitive landscape:

### Geographic Clustering
- Are competitors clustered in specific areas/zones?
- Which areas have high concentration vs sparse presence?
- Are there any "dead zones" with no competitors?

### Location Types
- Shopping malls and retail areas
- Main roads and commercial corridors
- Residential neighborhoods
- Near transit (metro stations, bus stops)

### Quality Segmentation
- Premium tier: High-rated (4.5+), likely higher prices
- Mid-market: Ratings 4.0-4.4
- Budget tier: Lower ratings or basic offerings
- Chain vs independent businesses

## Step 4: Strategic Assessment
Provide insights on:
- Which areas appear saturated with competitors?
- Which areas might be underserved opportunities?
- What quality gaps exist (e.g., no premium options)?
- Where are the strongest competitors located?

## Output Format
Provide a detailed competitor map with:
1. List of all competitors found with their details
2. Zone-by-zone breakdown of competition
3. Pattern analysis and clustering insights
4. Strategic opportunities and saturation warnings
